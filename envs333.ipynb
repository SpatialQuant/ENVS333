    "Note that each question has a number (1, 2, 3...), a sub-number, and (often) a sub-sub number. You should give these numbers as headers to your answers. This allows me to grade your answers accurately. **Hey, did you read that?** Every question, sub-question, and sub-sub-question gets its own answer. Recall that I hand out **Problem Sets**. You submit **Answer Sets**. If I have to look around your solutions to find the answers, you are missing the point. Make your answers clear, thoughtful, and full.  \n",

    "Unless I state otherwise, all problem sets must be submitted as Jupyter Notebooks. Please assemble all your answers into one notebook, and submit the file via BlackBoard. The file name format is Lastname_Firstinitial_PS_n. So if your name is Indy Jones, and you are submitting your answers to PS 3, the file name is \"Jones_I_PS2\". On the rare occasion where work done “by hand” is needed, you can use copier on campus to convert your work into pdfs."
